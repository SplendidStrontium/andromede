I was astounded when I looked at my git history, but I made Andromede way back in December 2015. It's been through a number of iterations, mostly simple and unsure of what they wanted to be. 

Today, Andromede has been rebuilt. I am starting from the ground up and building as much as I can from scratch. I have some big dreams for how far we can get so here's to hoping.

I am writing to mark the union of two sides of the early website. I knew that I wanted to document my progress building Andromede, while at the same time demonstrating its new features. I have been producing a static [blog](http://nan.nyc/) for a few years now, and I have been very pleased with how well it's been coming together. Markdown is easy to work with and I like having a plain-text collection of my posts. To bring a static blog to Andromede, I will be working with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.7.1/index.html). I had to make a few tweaks to get [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to talk to Pelican's html output; I may make a post detailing that at a later date.

My next goals:
1. improve presentation on mobile
2. change fonts
3. general visual theme
4. footer
5. collapse top right menu on mobile
6. add contact page with email form
7. begin first character-building tool 
8. improve markdown processing
